## Abstract

[Abstract](https://linktodocumentation): 
In the world of software development nowadays, many applications are available on both Android and iOS platforms. Each app solves a unique problem statement with a better solution and idea. In this modern era, apps are available to fulfill and understand the user's needs. In the same way nowadays, there are many laundry service platforms available in towns and rural areas, it is generally more likely to be found in multi-store residential or university buildings where there is usually a lot of cost or dorm. The general issue with the existing laundry applications is that users face many issues while booking the service. These existing laundry applications are not intuitive and user-friendly for the users while using the app. Students have certain communication issues with the service provider when using the laundry facilities at institutions located in different states or locations, and this gives a thumbs down to the laundry service provider for being unreliable. From this project, we hope to build a well- interactive, user-friendly, and secured laundry application for Android and iOS applications that helps users easily book their services and communicate easily with the service providers.
